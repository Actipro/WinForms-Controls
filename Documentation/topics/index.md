WinForms Studio is a bundled suite of professional user interface controls and components for Microsoft's Windows Forms (WinForms) framework.

## WinForms Control Products

### SyntaxEditor

![Screenshot](images/card-syntaxeditor.png)

[Actipro SyntaxEditor](syntaxeditor/index.md) is a powerful text editing control that is packed with features for efficient code editing, including syntax highlighting, line numbers, block selection, IntelliPrompt UI, code outlining, parsing, split views, zooming, bi-directional support, and much more.  It has many of the same code editing features found in the Visual Studio code editor.

SyntaxEditor is built on top of our next-generation extensible text/parsing framework.  While over 20 free sample languages are available to get you started (such as C#, VB, XML, and more), custom language definitions can be developed and distributed with your applications as well.  SyntaxEditor is designed for use in IDE (integrated development environment) applications, however there are many other applications out there that can take advantage of such a control.

This free add-on is included with SyntaxEditor:

- [LL(*) Parser Framework](syntaxeditor/ll-parser-framework/index.md) - Easily build advanced parsers using EBNF-like notation

These optional premium add-ons for advanced syntax language implementations are shipped and demoed with the @@PlatformName controls, but are sold separately:

- [.NET Languages Add-on](syntaxeditor/dotnet-languages-addon/index.md) - Advanced C# and Visual Basic
- [Python Language Add-on](syntaxeditor/python-language-addon/index.md) - Advanced Python
- [Web Languages Add-on](syntaxeditor/web-languages-addon/index.md) - Advanced XML, JavaScript, and JSON

### Bars

[Actipro Bars](bars/index.md) provides extensive bar user interface features similar to products like Visual Studio.  This includes dockable toolbars, standalone toolbars, popup menus, and statusbars.  The entire bar control system takes a different approach to design and implementation than other competitors.  The design of Actipro's bar controls is geared towards large applications, with a command / command link design pattern.  Several high-level features include:

- Docking on any side of a host
- Multiple [command link styles](bars/commands/index.md)
- Layout save/restore
- Full [run-time end-user customization](bars/run-time-customization.md) support
- Powerful [keyboard shortcut](bars/keyboard-shortcuts.md) model
- [Application modes](bars/application-modes.md)
- Programmatic control over the bar layout
- [Designer support](bars/designer/index.md)
- Multiple [built-in rendering styles](bars/extensible-rendering.md) with support for custom themes

### Docking & MDI

- [Alignment of tabs](docking/tabstrip/tab-alignments.md) to any side

### Shared Library

The [Actipro Shared Library](shared/index.md) contains the base WinUICore framework used by our other WinForms control products, along with a drawing framework, and some helpful controls like owner-drawn menus, markup label, scrollbar, and a color picker.

The Shared Library components are free for use by any licensed customers of our WinForms control products.

## The WinForms Studio Bundle

WinForms Studio is a bundled suite of all Actipro's WinForms control products listed above.

While the WinForms Studio suite provides enormous **price discounts** over ordering all of our WinForms products separately, you are free to purchase licenses for individual WinForms control products if you don't require the entire suite.

## Sample Browser

The Sample Browser is the main sample project that ships with WinForms Controls.

It is an application with full source code that is designed to provide information, demos, and QuickStarts for all of Actipro's WinForms control products.  This source code is invaluable for learning how to use the various WinForms control products.

The Sample Browser project can be opened with Visual Studio.
