# Overview

The Actipro Shared Library contains the base core framework used by our other WinForms control products, along with a drawing framework, and some helpful controls like owner-drawn menus, markup label, scrollbar, and a color picker. It's included free with any of our WinForms control products.

See the [Global Renderers](global-renderers.md) topic for more information on how global renderers can provide a consistent theme across an application and also save on resources since all controls of the same type reuse a single renderer as opposed to each control having its own renderer instance.
