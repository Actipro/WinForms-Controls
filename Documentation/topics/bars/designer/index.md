# Overview

The design-time capabilities provided by Visual Studio are fundamentally different when working with controls that target .NET Framework compared to controls that target .NET Core or .NET 5 and higher. The designer functionality for the Bars controls is optimized based on the target platform.

> [!NOTE]
> See the [Visual Studio Designer](../../visual-studio-designer.md) topic for details and requirements for designer functionality.

## .NET Framework

The Bars controls are specifically designed to make the design-time customization experience remarkably like the run-time customization experience. The Bars controls can be completely designed and customized in the designer and rely heavily on drag-and-drop functionality.

See the [Designer for .NET Framework](creating-layouts.netfx.md) topic for more information.

## .NET Core / .NET 5 and Higher

The Bars controls are fully customized in a standalone dialog which enables easy interaction with toolbars, menus, and commands.

See the [Designer for .NET Core / .NET 5 and Higher](creating-layouts.md) topic for more information.
