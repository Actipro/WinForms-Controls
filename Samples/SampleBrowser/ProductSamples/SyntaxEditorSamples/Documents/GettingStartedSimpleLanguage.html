					The numbered QuickStarts that follow this document show step-by-step how to construct a syntax language
					from scratch that has these features and more:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Lexer (shows both dynamic and programmatic options)</li>
					<li>Token tagger</li>
					<li>Classification type provider</li>
					<li>Parser based on the Actipro LL(*) Parser Framework, with customized tree construction and robust error handling</li>
					<li>AST generation</li>
					<li>Parse error reporting</li>
					<li>Parse error display via squiggle lines</li>
					<li>Parse error automated IntelliPrompt quick info</li>
					<li>Code outlining based on the AST</li>
					<li>Automated IntelliPrompt quick info for collapsed text</li>
					<li>Line commenting</li>
					<li>Language-specific context information generation for a specific offset</li>
					<li>Contextual-based IntelliPrompt quick info</li>
					<li>Contextual-based IntelliPrompt completion list and related Ctrl+Space support</li>
					<li>Contextual-based IntelliPrompt parameter info</li>
					<li>Smart indent provider</li>
					<li>Text formatter</li>
					<li>Delimiter (bracket) highlighting and auto-completion</li>
					<li>Navigable symbol provider</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					The syntax language built in this series is for the 'Simple' language,
					which is a simplified version of C and Javascript.
					See the documentation for a description of the language and its EBNF.
				</p>

				<p>
					This series is the perfect place to start when building your own syntax language implementations
					as it walks through the correct process to construct a syntax language, and shows
					the power of the SyntaxEditor framework that can be harnessed by your language.
					Our own advanced syntax language implementations (such as in the Web Languages Add-on)
					use the same design techniques and fundamentals described here.
				</p>

				<p>
					We hope that you enjoy this series.
					As you work through each step in the series, be sure to consult the related documentation
					topics to learn more about each feature area being discussed.
