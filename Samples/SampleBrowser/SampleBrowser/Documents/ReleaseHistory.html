				<ul>
					<li>Improved the selected tabbed MDI container to not repaint its contents when its parent Form is activated or deactivated.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>SyntaxEditor</h4>
				<h5>Cross-Platform Design</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>The WinForms SyntaxEditor has been rewritten to support a cross-platform API across the WPF, UWP, and WinForms platforms.  This allows SyntaxEditor features for the three platforms to be kept in sync moving forward.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Scrolling and Zooming</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Added smooth inertia-based touch scrolling.</li>
					<li>Added support for Shift+MouseWheel to scroll editor views horizontally.</li>
					<li>Added the IEditorViewScroller.ScrollTo method that scrolls the view to a certain view line, which can easily be displayed to the top, center, or bottom of the view via options in the supplied TextViewScrollState struct.</li>
					<li>Added the IEditorViewScroller.ScrollByPixels and ScrollHorizontallyByPixels methods, allowing for diagonal and horizontal scrolling by pixels respectively.</li>
					<li>When resizing a view that is scrolled to the right, the horizontal scroll amount can adjust to ensure that there isn't too much empty space on the text area's right side.</li>
					<li>The view now remembers maximum line widths better, which prevents horizontal scrollbar maximum changing as much when scrolling vertically through lines that have very different widths.</li>
					<li>Mouse wheel scrolling now supports page-based scrolling if the related operating system option is chosen.</li>
					<li>ScrollBar acceleration features added where the vertical scrollbar accelerates its scrolling speed the longer you hold the up or down button..</li>
					<li>Updated the NavigableSymbolSelector control to scroll the target offset to the middle of the view if scrolling is required when a symbol is selected.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Carets and Selection</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Multiple selections, each with their own caret, are now supported as long as the new SyntaxEditor.AreMultipleSelectionRangesEnabled property is true.  A new selection can be added by holding the Ctrl key when clicking in the text area or clicking on the selection or line number margins.</li>
					<li>Properties on the IEditorView.Selection object continue to operate on the primary selection range.  A new Ranges property has been added to the IEditorView.Selection object that allows for enumeration of all selection ranges.</li>
					<li>Multiple selections can be set with the new IEditorView.Selection.SelectRanges method, or a new selection can be added with the AddRange method.</li>
					<li>Most edit actions have been refactored to fully support multiple selections.  For instance, pressing Shift+Right Arrow will extend all of the selections by one character.</li>
					<li>Copying text from multiple selections unions the selected text, joining each range's text with a line terminator.</li>
					<li>Pasting multi-line text into a view with the same number of selections as text lines being pasted will replace each selection with a related line from the pasted text.</li>
					<li>The IEditorView.DeleteSelectedText and ReplaceSelectedText methods have been refactored to support applying to multiple selections when the EditorViewTextChangeOptions.CanApplyToMultipleSelections flag is set.</li>
					<li>Selection grippers will show for the primary selection when touch input is used.</li>
					<li>Carets now support movement at both the start and end of word wrapped lines.</li>
					<li>Rendering of virtual space selections is improved.</li>
					<li>Block selections can be made in virtual space at the end of lines, even without line end virtual space being enabled.  This prevents the caret from snapping to an offset when making a block selection, which can sometimes be problematic.</li>
					<li>Added the ITextChange.PostSelectionPositionRanges property that indicates the exact selection ranges for the source view after the text change is applied.</li>
					<li>Added the EditorViewSelectionEventArgs.PreviousSelectionRanges property that contains a snapshot of all selection ranges prior to the selection change.</li>
					<li>Added collapse selection left and collapse selection right edit actions.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Searching</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>A new search overlay pane displays over the upper-right of the active editor view when Ctrl+F (find mode) or Ctrl+H (replace mode) are pressed in a multi-line editor.  Related edit actions added.</li>
					<li>A toggle mode button on the search overlay pane switches between find and replace modes, and all common search options are supported via toggle buttons and other controls.</li>
					<li>The search overlay pane can be closed by clicking the X button or by pressing Esc.</li>
					<li>Ctrl+F3 will open the search overlay pane without focusing it, and will search forward for the currently-selected text.  Ctrl+Shift+F3 will do the same but will search backwards.  Related edit actions added.</li>
					<li>F3 will search for the next match of the previously-used search options.  Shift+F3 will search for the previous match of the previously-used search options.  Related edit actions added.</li>
					<li>If the SyntaxEditor.IsSearchResultHighlightingEnabled property is true, the search results will be highlighted while the search overlay pane is open.  Closing the search overlay pane, clears the search result highlights.</li>
					<li>The new SyntaxEditor.OverlayPaneOpened and OverlayPaneClosed events fire when the search overlay pane is opened or closed.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Splitting</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Updated the scrollbar splitter button with a larger appearance.</li>
					<li>Drag a view splitter to the bottom of the view to remove the split and keep the top view.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Margins</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Added the ITextViewLineNumberProvider language service with a DefaultTextViewLineNumberProvider implementation that allows for complete customization of how line numbers are rendered in the line number margin.  Added the IEditorDocument.LineNumberOrigin property that sets the line number for the first line in the document, and defaults to one.</li>
					<li>Added the ruler margin, which is displayed via the SyntaxEditor.IsRulerMarginVisible property.</li>
					<li>Added outlining margin highlights when moving a pointer over nodes in the margin.</li>
					<li>Updated line modification marks with improved logic that better tracks unsaved, saves, and reverted changes.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Indicators</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Updated the IIndicatorTag interface to use the fast new rendering mechanism for drawing glyphs instead of making UI elements.</li>
					<li>Improved the rendering of built-in indicator glyphs.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Delimiters</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Added the SyntaxEditor.IsDelimiterAutoCompleteEnabled property to determine if syntax languages support delimiter auto-completion.  Delimiter auto-completion can be implemented by registering an IDelimiterAutoCompleter language service.  The built-in DelimiterAutoCompleter class implements common delimiter auto-completion functionality.</li>
					<li>Added the SyntaxEditor.IsDelimiterHighlightingEnabled property to determine if multi-threaded delimiter highlighting is enabled.  IStructureMatcher and DelimiterHighlightTagger provider services are required on the syntax language to support this feature.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Input and Editing</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Added the PerformTyping, PerformInsertTyping, and PerformOverwriteTyping methods to the IEditorViewTextChangeActions interface that simulate typing.</li>
					<li>Added the IEditorViewTextChangeActions.FormatDocument and FormatSelection methods, which call the related edit commands.</li>
					<li>Improved the open line above and open line below edit actions to use the current language's indent provider for caret positioning.</li>
					<li>Added support for triple-clicks to select an entire view line.  Dragging the pointer on the final click will extend the selection by view line.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>IntelliPrompt</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>IntelliPrompt UI reworked across all platforms.</li>
					<li>The Metro Light and Metro Dark common image sets have been added as options in place of the existing Classic common image set.</li>
					<li>Added a completion list feature that highlights the matched text in completion items as you type.</li>
					<li>Added a completion list option that filters out items that don't match the typed text, thereby shrinking the list of visible items.</li>
					<li>Added various completion list item matchers and match options that allow for special item matching logic to be injected.  Numerous built-in item matchers are available such as starts-with, acronym, shorthand, etc.</li>
					<li>Added completion filter UI such as buttons and tabs.</li>
					<li>Updated all language add-on IntelliPrompt quick info and parameter info tips to use the current editor background and syntax highlighting colors.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Text Rendering</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Text rendering now properly handles cultural editing concepts like complex glyphs, bi-directional text, etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>The SyntaxEditor.IsDefaultContextMenuEnabled property determines if the default context menu is enabled.  The default context menu is initialized and passed into the new SyntaxEditor.MenuRequested when a menu is requested for display.  Handle the MenuRequested event to update the menu's items before it is opened.</li>
					<li>Added the SyntaxEditor.IsWordWrapEnabled property for easy binding in menu items.</li>
					<li>Language features are now implemented via services registered on syntax languages.</li>
					<li>The TypeMemberDropDownList control in the .NET Languages Add-on changed to a new NavigableSymbolSelector control that can work for many languages.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>.NET Languages Add-on</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Updated the C# parser and resolver to support C# 7.3 syntax.</li>
					<li>Updated the VB parser and resolver to support VB 15.8 syntax.</li>
